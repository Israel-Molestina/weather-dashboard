## Task

As a frequent Travel, I want to be able to see the weather forecast for multiple cities, So I can plan my trips accordingly.

## The Application

Using the Open Weather API and the Luxon library, I've created an application that allows a user to input a city of their choice, and receive back the current and future weather predictions. The application works as follows:

* When a user searches for a city, they are presented with current and future weather conditions for that city, and the city is added to a search history,

* When a user views the current weather conditions for a city, they are presented with the city name, date, an icon that represents the weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed and the UV index.

* The UV index is presented with a color that indicates favorable moderate or severe conditions.

* When the user views the future weather conditions, they are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, a weather icon, the temperature and the humidity.

* When the user clicks on a city in the search history, they are presented with all the current and future conditions of the city again.
